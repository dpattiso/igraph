The context of the research presented herein is the development of an active supervision system for a multi-agent environment. With the idea of using o -the-shelf components, we have implemented a rst version of the control framework. Speci cally, the creation of distributed plans is achieved by using BlackBox in a domain in which time and resource features have been abstracted away, and cascading it with O-Oscar to accommodate this further information. The result, although preliminary, shows how such planning and scheduling components can contribute an interesting coordination service for realistic applications.},
